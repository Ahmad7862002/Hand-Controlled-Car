# Hand-Controlled-Car


By the way you move your fingers a number is generated.This number is sent to the other MC and then it is broken down to a certain motor movement based on the number.

If you only raise your thumb and close all, it will turn right.
If you only raise your pinky and close all, it will turn left.
If you only raise your index finger and close all, it will move forward with medium speed.
If you only raise your index and middle finger and close all, it will move forward with high speed.
If you raise all your fingers, it will move backwards.
If you close all fingers, it will stop.
